title: Contributing to course material
---


Extra credit will be given to students who make contributions to the course material. My philosophy is that the course material is not a static entity to be absorbed, but a dynamic resource you engage with and help improve. Participating in the improvement of the course material is a great way to practice the skills you have learned. Because this is done through GitHub pull requests, it is also a way to practice (in a low-stakes setting) contributing to a public code repository. This is a very desirable skill in the job market. Employers often ask to see your github account, even for non-engineering jobs. 

You can find more detailed information about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on GitHub. Here is a quick guide.

## How to Make a Pull Request on GitHub (without creating a local fork)

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com). Click **Sign up** in the top-right corner and create an account. 
2. Once logged in, go to the course repository. 
3. At the top of the repository page, click the branch dropdown (it usually says `main` or `master`). Type in a new branch name that describes your change (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-example`). Press **Enter** to create the new branch.
4. Edit files directly on GitHub:
   1. Navigate to the file you want to change.  
   2. Click the pencil icon (**Edit this file**).  
   3. Make your changes in the browser.  
   4. Scroll down, write a clear commit message, and choose **Commit directly to the new branch**.  
5. After committing your changes, GitHub will prompt you to create a pull request.  
   - If you don’t see the prompt, click the **Pull requests** tab and then **New pull request**.
6. Ensure that:
   - The **base branch** is `main` (or the default branch of the repo).  
   - The **compare branch** is your new branch.
7. Add a descriptive title and a detailed description of your changes (e.g., “fixed typo in Unit 3 Exercise 4” or “added example to Unit 8”). 
8. Click **Create pull request**.
9. Wait for my review. I may not end up merging your changes for various reasons. For example, you might come up with a good problem, but it is too difficult or not aligned with the flow of the course. I will still give you credit if there is meaningful effort.
