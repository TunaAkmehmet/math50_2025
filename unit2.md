# Expectation, Continuous probability, CLT and Normal models

In this section we introduce **expectation**, an operation which takes a random variable and produces a deterministic quantity. The expectation of a random variable can be appoximated with **sample averages** and from them we can infer properties of the model (like paramaters). This will motivate us to study the probability distribution of sums of random variables, which leads to the **CLT** and the **Normal distribution.**

# Concepts

Expectation, conditional expectation, emperical averages, CLT, Normal random variables and their properties, coefficient of variation

# Things to practice

- Calculate expectations by hand and in Python. 
- Manipulate normal random variables  (apply linearity of expectation and independence to simplify calculations.)
- How to use CLT to estimate probabilities of sums (and know when the CLT gives an accurate approximation)
- Determine if the Normal model is a good model from data.
