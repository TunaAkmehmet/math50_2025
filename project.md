# Overview


## Introduction

The project will be due on **November 22nd before midnight**.

The goal of the project is to apply what you've learned to a realy world setting; that is, to use statistics to say something new about the real world! 
It will include (at least one) Python notebook and a **2–3 page** report. You can work in a group of up to 3, but you will all get the same grade on the project portion. Your report should be **single spaced, 12pt font with 1-inch margins**. Your report will be graded out of 100 points and your grade is **roughly** based on the following:

- Your report should be clearly written and include citations (I don't care about the format) of any literature beyond the main paper which you referenced (10%).
- Summarize the liture on the topic you are studying in 2–4 paragraphs, making an effort to connect it to what we've covered in class (15%).
- You should apply at least 3 concepts we used in class in your analysis  (35%).
- You should use a probability model beyond a single-predictor linear regression (10%). 
- You should write some Python code to accompany your report and link to your Colab notebook. **Remember to give me permission to view it!** For example, you might simulate a model discussed in the article (15%).
- You should pose at least one question or future direction which is not raised or answered in the article (15%).
