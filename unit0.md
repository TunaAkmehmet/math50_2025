## Prerequisite material

These are things I will **not** cover in class which you should know: 

- **Plotting**: Know how to interpret plots on a log scale, contour plots, histograms, and boxplots. You do not need to know how to create these plots in Python, but you will be asked to **interpret them**.  
- **Basic linear algebra**: Some familiarity will be helpful to understand concepts starting in Unit 4. However, I will not ask any exam questions that require you to do linear algebra calculations.  
- **Coding fundamentals**:  
  - `for` loops, `while` loops, `if` statements  
  - Indexing arrays (in this course, exam questions will only involve indexing **1-D NumPy arrays**)  

I will cover in class:  
- Working with **pandas DataFrames** (loading CSVs, selecting columns, summarizing data).  
- How to use `numpy.random`. That said, it’s helpful to review it beforehand.

## Resources for coding

If you are new to Python or rusty, I recommend spending an hour or two going through a short tutorial.  

- **Official Python tutorial (control flow, functions):**  
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/  

- **NumPy basics (arrays, indexing, random draws):**  
  - Absolute beginner’s guide: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html  
  - Indexing and slicing: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html  

- **pandas (skim only for now):**  
  https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/  

If you want more interactive practice:  
- [W3Schools Python NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)  
- [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) (short, free, hands-on)

## Suggested prep

- Practice writing simple Python functions and using `for`/`while` loops.  
- Be comfortable with 1-D NumPy array indexing (`x[0]`, `x[-1]`, `x[2:5]`, `x[x>0]`).  
- Look over `numpy.random` to see how to draw from uniform and normal distributions.  
- Browse a few examples of histograms, boxplots, log-scale plots, and contour plots. You should be able to say what the plot tells you, not how to make it.

That’s it — if you can do the above, you’ll be well prepared.
