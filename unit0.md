## Prerequisite material

These are things I will **not** cover in class, but you should know:

- **Calculus**: You should know how to take derivatives and integrals of polynomial and exponential functions. I won't ask you to calculate an integral on the exam, but it will be important for understanding a few derivations I perform in class.
- **Plotting**: Know how to interpret plots on a log scale, contour plots, histograms, and boxplots. You do not need to know how to create these plots in Python, but you will be asked to interpret them.  
- **Basic linear algebra**: Some familiarity will be helpful to understand concepts starting in Unit 3: 
  - Basic operations: Matrix-vector, matrix-matrix multiplication and addition
  - Matrix inversion: I won't ask you to calculate any matrix inverses by hand, but you will need to know what it means
  You do not need to know about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I will introduce these concepts as needed how.  I will not ask any exam questions that require you to do linear algebra calculations.
- **Coding fundamentals**: You should be comfortable with `for` loops, `while` loops, `if` statements (not necessarily in Python), and the meaning of the equals sign in coding vs. math. If you come from R, you may have used `<-`, but in Python we use `=` to assign variables. 

Some things I will cover in class are:
- Working with `numpy` arrays.
- Working with **pandas DataFrames** (loading CSVs, selecting columns, summarizing data).
- How to use `numpy.random` to generate samples.

That said, it’s helpful to review these beforehand, especially if you have limited experience coding.

## Resources for coding

If you are new to Python, I recommend spending an hour or two going through a short tutorial.  

- **Official Python tutorial (control flow, functions):**  
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/  

- **NumPy basics (arrays, indexing, random draws):**  
  - Absolute beginner’s guide: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html  
  - Indexing and slicing: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html  

- **pandas (skim only for now):**  
  https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/
