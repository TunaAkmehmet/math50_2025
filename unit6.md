# Overparameterized models: Regularization, priors and Bayesian inference

At this point we have seen that models can be too complicated, but thus far **complexity** has roughly meant the number of parameters (regression coefficients). Striking a balance between bias and variance means finding the right number of predictors to include, but there are ways to build highly flexibly models which do not overfit.s

# Concepts
Regularization for regression models, Priors, Laplace rule of succession, Bayes rule, posterior distributions, how priors influence the posterior for simple models, connection between regularization and priors. 

# What you need to know
- How to select and justify priors (using Normal probabilities or lognormal)
- For estimating the sample mean, be able to calculate the influence of a given regularization of the least squares estimator by hand
- Implement regularization in Python and have back of the envelope idea of the effects on regression coefficients. 
- Be able to translate priors to regularization for ridge regression (and vice versa)
